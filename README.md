# brian32768/geomoose

I took the Dockerfile from the Geomoose github and copied it here so that I could automate
the build process and publish the image on the Docker hub.

IMO there are numerous problems with this image, but I am only interesting
in testing Geomoose so I am not trying to improve it.

Refer to the official Geomoose docs for more details.
